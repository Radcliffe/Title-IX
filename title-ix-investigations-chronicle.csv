University officials had discovered surveillance video showing the men carrying an unconscious female student into a residence hall and referred the case to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. In November 2013, a group of students and recent alumni filed federal Title IX and Clery Act complaints against the university, alleging that it had responded inadequately to reports of sexual assault. Vanderbilt was one of the initial 55 colleges under investigation in this wave of federal enforcement as announced by the Education Department in May 2014. Campus officials have said the investigation is based not on a complaint but a proactive compliance review. Federal officials planned to visit the campus in January 2015. One student who filed a federal complaint against the institution has spoken publicly about her experience. She later called Title IX enforcement a horribly broken process that needs to be re-evaluated and said she didnt see these complaints making the changes that we want.

The review was said to have been separate from inquiries related to the Sandusky child-sex-abuse scandal. A damning report on that scandal had been released two years earlier, in the summer of 2012. At the time the department said OCR was reviewing Penn State, Catherine E. Lhamon, the department's assistant secretary for civil rights, said  the review was motivated in part by """"a dramatic increase in the number of forcible sex offenses occurring on campus as reported by the university itself."""" A prominent campus-safety expert said at the time that the sharp increase in reporting could be explained by Penn State's efforts to strengthen its compliance with the federal law known as the Clery Act in the wake of the Sandusky scandal. In May 2014, the Education Department identified Penn State in an initial list of 55 institutions facing a federal inquiry for potential Title IX violations over their handling of sexual-violence cases. The following spring, the Penn State chapter of the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity attracted national attention when news reports revealed that the fraternity had allegedly maintained private Facebook pages featuring featuring photos of unsuspecting nude women, some of whom appeared to be incapacitated or asleep. Penn State pulled its recognition of the fraternity for three years, and the group's national office expelled 38 members from the organization. Penn State's president, Eric J. Barron, announced the formation of a task force to study the role of Greek groups at the university. Students have protested the institutions handling of sexual assault. A former Penn State student sued the university and the fraternity over what he said was the Greek group's pattern of """"extreme hazing"""" and sexual assaults. The institution has affirmed its commitment to victims of sexual assault, collected resources online, taken steps to improve its compliance with Title IX and the Clery Act, and convened a task force to examine the role of Greek life at Penn State.

The victim has said that she filed a federal complaint against Stanford in December 2014. Students have protested the institutions handling of sexual assault and continued to organize. Stanford has conducted a climate survey, finding that 2 percent of all students have had experiences since enrolling there that meet a definition of sexual assault based on California law. Among undergraduate women, 5 percent said they had been sexually assaulted, and another 33 percent reported sexual misconduct, a category including sexual touching without consent. Some activists have objected to the surveys methodology and results. The institution has affirmed its commitment to victims of sexual assault, collected resources online, introduced a new disciplinary process, and created a task force to enhance prevention and improve policies, as well as support for victims. A student who participated in an investigation of sexual harassment at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity, which ultimately lost its housing privileges, has spoken out about the retaliation against her and a general fear of reporting on the campus. A male student wrote a detailed account in the campus newspaper in January 2015 of having been sexually assaulted by a female classmate.

She carried the mattress at her graduation ceremony in May 2015. Students have protested the institutions handling of sexual assault.

Students have protested the institutions handling of sexual assault, including the response of its president, Susan Herbst, to the fall 2013 Title IX complaint. Allegations that the university was indifferent to reports of sexual assault, she said, were astonishingly misguided and demonstrably untrue. Four of those complainants also filed a federal lawsuit against the university, accusing it of violating their civil rights. The plaintiffs, all women, have spoken publicly about their experiences. In April 2014, the Connecticut State Senate unanimously approved legislation that requires colleges to immediately supply victims of sexual assault with written statements of their rights and to make annual reports to the states General Assembly. In July 2014, UConn said it would pay nearly $1.3 million to settle the lawsuit. The university did not admit any wrongdoing and maintained that it categorically denies the allegations, but it outlined several new steps to respond to campus sexual assault. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw their Title IX complaint.

Students have protested what they see as a rape culture on the campus and an insufficiently responsive administration. This federal investigation began as a compliance review in 2011, soon after the Education Department had signaled tougher enforcement of Title IX, and was modified to include a federal complaint filed on behalf of a student in 2012. That student sued the Education Department in 2014, demanding that it resolve her complaint.

About 24 percent of female undergraduates said they had experienced nonconsensual penetration or sexual touching due to physical force or incapacitation since arriving on the campus, according to a climate survey by the Association of American Universities. About 41 percent of all students believed it was very or extremely likely that UVa would conduct a fair investigation. The federal Title IX investigation has been resolved, with the Education Department finding that the university had violated the gender-equity law for failing to promptly and equitably respond to certain complaints of sexual violence. The department determined that a basis for a hostile environment existed for affected students and that the university failed to eliminate a hostile environment and take steps to prevent its recurrence during certain time periods from 2008 to 2014. According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, university and public officials waged an intense battle to influence the outcome of the federal investigation. Under the settlement, UVa agreed, among other things, to follow its revised sexual-misconduct policies, develop a system for tracking all reports, review those from 2011-14 to determine whether each was handled appropriately, allow the Education Department to review reports and monitor institutional response through the 2015-16 academic year, provide regular training to students and employees, and improve outreach to students. A state task force in Virginia issued several recommendations in the spring of 2015, including to require public and private colleges to create sexual-assault-response teams, to conduct climate surveys at public colleges every two years, and to develop a state grant program to support research on gender-based-violence prevention.

In another case, a female student who filed a federal complaint against the institution in November 2014 for allegedly mishandling a reported sexual assault also sued two alleged perpetrators. In a separate case, the university reversed its judgment against a male student it had found responsible for sexual assault in 2012. He had sued the university, arguing that the disciplinary process violated his due-process rights and led to the wrong conclusion. The institution has affirmed its commitment to victims of sexual assault, collected resources online, conducted two climate surveys, expanded training progams, and created a special victims unit within the campus police department. It has had a Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center since 1986. In the universitys own climate survey, released in June 2015, 23 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing nonconsensual kissing, touching, or sexual penetration in the past year. Less than 4 percent of all students said they had reported those incidents to university or law-enforcement officials. About 30 percent of female undergraduates said they had experienced nonconsensual penetration or sexual touching due to physical force or incapacitation since arriving on the campus, according to a climate survey by the Association of American Universities released in September 2015. About 40 percent of all students believed it was very or extremely likely that the university would conduct a fair investigation.",-83.7371794,42.2783714

The subsequent publicity and developments in the case of Landen Gambill put the university at the center of growing national awareness to the problem of campus rape. In January 2013, Ms. Gambill and four other people  three other students or former students and a former administrator  filed a Title IX complaint against the university. The two former students  Annie Clark and Andrea Pino  went on to become the leaders of a movement to encourage similar complaints at universities across the country. The complaint was unusual in that it also claimed that the university pressured the former administrator who joined the complainants to underreport the number of sexual assaults to the federal government, the university's student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported. It also alleged that the former assistant dean of students was subject to a threatening and hostile work environment. The university flatly denied the allegations. In February 2013, Ms. Gambill said the university's Honor Court had charged her with harassing the man she had accused of rape because she had provided enough information in her public statements about him to effectively reveal his identity. That prompted Ms. Gambill to file a federal retaliation complaint against the university. Months later, the university's then-chancellor, Holden Thorp, informed the campus that he was dismissing the charge. Soon after Ms. Gambill went public with her accusations, her ex-boyfriend went public with accusations of his own, disputing her account of their relationship and claiming the university trampled on his due-process rights in its investigation of Ms. Gambill's claims.

The complaint that Ms. Murphy filed was resolved almost four years later, when Princeton entered into a resolution agreement with the Education Department. The department's Office for Civil Rights said that the university had violated Title IX for failing to """"promptly and equitably"""" respond to complaints of sexual violence, and for failing to end what the department called a """"sexually hostile environment for one student."""" Before the agreement was announced, the university adopted a """"preponderance of the evidence"""" standard in sexual-violence investigations, a standard that the government has said that Title IX requires. That standard is lower than the one used in criminal cases, and is lower than one Princeton had previously used, which required """"clear and persuasive"""" evidence that an assault had occurred. The department credited the university with correcting deficiencies that OCR had identified in the course of the investigation, and Princeton agreed to take additional steps to improve its handling of sexual-violence allegations. In September 2015, the university released the results of a survey on sexual misconduct. The survey found that 34 percent of undergraduate women respondents said that they had experienced some form of inappropriate sexual behavior.

Four of the complainants also filed a federal lawsuit against the university, accusing it of violating their civil rights by inadequately responding to their reports of sexual assault. The lawsuit, which a fifth plaintiff later joined, sought damages for emotional distress and asked the court to order the university to revise its policies. The plaintiffs, all women, have spoken publicly about their experiences. Students have protested the institutions handling of sexual assault, including the response of its president, Susan Herbst, to the Title IX complaint. Allegations that the university was indifferent to reports of sexual assault, she said, were astonishingly misguided and demonstrably untrue. In April 2014, the Connecticut State Senate unanimously approved legislation that requires colleges to immediately supply victims of sexual assault with written statements of their rights and to make annual reports to the states General Assembly. UConn was one of the initial 55 colleges under investigation in this wave of federal enforcement as announced by the Education Department in May 2014. In July 2014, the university said it would pay nearly $1.3 million to settle the lawsuit. Most of that sum, $900,000, went to one plaintiff who said she had been kicked off the womens hockey team after reporting that she was raped by a men's hockey player. The university did not admit any wrongdoing and maintained that it categorically denies the allegations, but it outlined several new steps to respond to campus sexual assault. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw their federal Title IX complaint. However, as that complaint also included three other students who were not part of the lawsuit, the investigation continued. The institution has affirmed its commitment to victims of sexual assault; collected resources online; hired a new assistant dean of students for victim support services; formed a Title IX investigations team, special-victims unit in the campus police department, community resource team, and bystander-intervention task force; and continued to modify its policies and procedures.

A fellow University of Illinois student allegedly filmed, photographed, and shared images from the incident. The complainant and the university agreed to a settlement in May 2013, effectively ending the federal civil-rights investigation based on her complaint. The university admitted no wrongdoing but paid her $77,000 and announced that it would better train staff and revise its policies for responding to reports of sexual assault. The former student agreed not to sue the university, but she has filed a lawsuit against the fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, as well as several of its members and her alleged assailant, according to the Chicago Tribune. The investigation was resolved through early complaint resolution, which means the institution reached an agreement with the complainant(s), and there is no letter of findings or resolution agreement from the Education Department.

"University of Montana at Missoula",138,"www.umt.edu","http://projects.chronicle.com/titleix/case/138","May 4, 2012","Resolved","1year","May 9, 2013","Sexual assault gained attention on the campus after reports in the fall of 2011 that two female students had been sexually assaulted, allegedly by football players. The university hired a former state Supreme Court justice to investigate, and the following spring, after she found that the university appears to have a gap in reporting sexual assaults, the university system's Board of Regents announced an investigation of  several further reports, and the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education began formal reviews. Under public scrutiny for how it handled sexual-assault allegations involving athletes, the university fired its football coach and athletic director in early 2012. A few months later, the institution announced that an administrator who had drawn controversy for an email asking if a female student could have violated the universitys student-conduct code by speaking out about being raped would step down. The institution has affirmed its commitment to victims of sexual assault, collected resources online, held forums on preventing sexual assault, and introduced a mandatory online training program for students (before such training became a federal requirement) on the definitions of sexual assault and consent, as well as tips on bystander intervention and resources for victims. The unusually high-profile federal investigation took a year to resolve, with the Education and Justice Departments finding a tangle of misguided policies and biased procedures, including """"inconsistent and inadequate"""" definitions of sexual harassment; a student population unaware of or confused about how to report sexual misconduct; and a lengthy grievance process focusing on the accused perpetrator's due-process rights while largely ignoring the rights of the alleged victim. Federal officials denounced Montanas handling of the issue, recognizing some progress but requiring much more. The settlement, tougher and more precise than those in previous investigations, became a model for subsequent ones. The university agreed, among other things, to hire an """"equity consultant""""; revise and widely distribute its policies and procedures; provide Title IX training to all faculty and staff members; develop a confidential tracking system for reports of sexual misconduct; create a """"resource guide"""" for students; and conduct focus groups and annual climate surveys to assess students' familiarity and comfort with the grievance process. A separate agreement with the campus public-safety department required a safety and accountability audit, an independent reviewer to monitor progress, and an external review team of sexual-assault experts and advocates to ensure consistency. I want this university to emerge as an institution that recognized a problem and came out as a national leader in addressing that problem, said the universitys president, Royce C. Engstrom. We are on our way. The new requirements came with a strict timetable, and the general counsel made a spreadsheet to track them. In response to a federal officials remark that the settlement with Montana served as a blueprint for colleges and universities across the country to take effective steps to prevent and address sexual assault and harassment on their campuses, advocates for womens rights hailed that as important progress, but defenders of free speech raised a furor over what they saw as a redefinition of sexual harassment to mean almost anything. A book by Jon Krakauer in April 2015 detailed the circumstances surrounding several alleged sexual assaults in Missoula from 2010 to 2012 and chronicled the many failings of local law-enforcement officials in investigating and prosecuting the cases. It focused more on public officials than on administrators, but the author noted how universities are so willing to abandon the welfare of their students to protect their brand and to abuse federal student privacy law to avoid accountability.",-113.980702,46.863037

"Yale University",159,"www.yale.edu","http://projects.chronicle.com/titleix/case/159","April 1, 2011","Resolved","1year, 2months","June 15, 2012","Sexual assault gained attention on the campus when, in October 2010, male students pledging a fraternity repeated a sexually aggressive chant (""""No means yes, yes means anal"""") outside Yale's Women's Center. The incident was recorded, posted to YouTube, and circulated among students. In March 2011, a group of 16 Yale students and alumni filed a federal Title IX complaint against the university, alleging that it had failed to eliminate a sexually hostile environment. In addition to the fraternity chant, the complaint cited other incidents such as a preseason scouting report in which a group of male students ranked freshman women in order of how many beers it would take to have sex with them. The university, the students argued, had responded inadequately to a long trend of public sexual harassment, as well as to several individual reports of sexual harassment and assault. Yale has a long history of activism against sexual violence. A lawsuit involving the university more than a decade ago helped establish that victims of rape could be considered subjects of discrimination under Title IX. And in the late 1970s, five female students sued Yale in one of the first sexual-harassment cases to use Title IX, arguing that a university should have procedures for students to file formal reports of misconduct. The institution has affirmed its commitment to victims of sexual assault, collected resources online, formed a campuswide committee, updated its policies and procedures, conducted climate surveys, suspended the fraternity responsible for the chant, and regularly released reports of allegations of sexual misconduct. The investigation has been resolved, with the Education Department not finding Yale in violation of Title IX, but criticizing some of its previous policies and saying that students had reported """"a chain of incidents to which the university did not effectively respond."""" At the same time, federal officials praised the university for """"proactively"""" introducing numerous new policies and procedures to try to achieve a safer, more supportive environment for students. Under the settlement, Yale agreed, among other things, to continue to improve and publicize efforts to prevent and respond to sexual harassment and violence, implement its new grievance process, and train students and employees. It marked the first major settlement after the Education Department's letter to colleges in 2011 signaling stricter enforcement of Title IX, but the cooperative tone turned tougher in subsequent investigations. One of the complainants, dissatisfied with the outcome of the investigation, helped organize a rally at the Education Department in 2013 to demand tighter enforcement of Title IX, with stricter sanctions when institutions fail to support victims of sexual assault. """"This pattern of letting schools off the hook is all too common,"""" she said, joining hundreds of students and activists nationwide in a movement to force colleges to change how they handle reports of rape. In 2013, the Education Department hit Yale with one of the largest fines ever under the campus-crime-reporting law known as the Clery Act for failing to report forcible sex offenses on its campus more than a decade before. In 2014, a Yale graduate who had been accused of sexual assault as a student spoke publicly about how a well-intended policy can produce disastrous consequences if it remains detached from the most basic elements of fairness and due process that form the foundation of our legal system.",-72.93107,41.30652

In May 2014, the Education Department identified Ohio State in its initial list of 55 institutions facing a federal inquiry for potential Title IX violations over their handling of sexual-violence cases. During the course of OCR's review, the university conducted an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment within its renowned marching band. In July 2014, the university fired the band's director after releasing a report concluding that he had overseen a culture of rampant harassment. Four months later, the university reached a resolution agreement with OCR after the office found that Ohio State's policies had violated Title IX. The department credited the university with taking many steps to improve its compliance with Title IX and its climate during the review. The institution has affirmed its commitment to victims of sexual assault, collected resources online, and agreed to take additional steps to improve its policies as part of the resolution agreement. After OCR closed the case that included Ohio State's investigation of its marching band, the office opened another inquiry regarding the university's handling of sexual-violence cases.

The review was said to have been separate from inquiries related to the Sandusky child-sex-abuse scandal. A damning report on that scandal had been released two years earlier, in the summer of 2012. At the time the department said OCR was reviewing Penn State, Catherine E. Lhamon, the department's assistant secretary for civil rights, said  the review was motivated in part by """"a dramatic increase in the number of forcible sex offenses occurring on campus as reported by the university itself."""" A prominent campus-safety expert said at the time that the sharp increase in reporting could be explained by Penn State's efforts to strengthen its compliance with the federal law known as the Clery Act in the wake of the Sandusky scandal. In May 2014, the Education Department identified Penn State in an initial list of 55 institutions facing a federal inquiry for potential Title IX violations over their handling of sexual-violence cases. The following spring, the Penn State chapter of the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity attracted national attention when news reports revealed that the fraternity had allegedly maintained private Facebook pages featuring featuring photos of unsuspecting nude women, some of whom appeared to be incapacitated or asleep. Penn State pulled its recognition of the fraternity for three years, and the group's national office expelled 38 members from the organization. Penn State's president, Eric J. Barron, announced the formation of a task force to study the role of Greek groups at the university. Students have protested the institutions handling of sexual assault. A former Penn State student sued the university and the fraternity over what he said was the Greek group's pattern of """"extreme hazing"""" and sexual assaults. The institution has affirmed its commitment to victims of sexual assault, collected resources online, taken steps to improve its compliance with Title IX and the Clery Act, and convened a task force to examine the role of Greek life at Penn State. This federal investigation at the university was closed in April 2014, with the Education Department citing insufficient evidence as the reason for the resolution. That means there is no resolution agreement. No letter of findings has yet been made public. There is another open investigation at Penn State.",-77.8653126,40.8147955

They said administrators had discouraged them from formally reporting the incidents, neglected to update them on any investigation, and failed to punish their assailants, according to Al Jazeera America. Berkeley was one of the initial 55 colleges under investigation in this wave of federal enforcement as announced by the Education Department in May 2014.
